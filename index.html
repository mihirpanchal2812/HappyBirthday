              <div class="text-one">A very Happy Birthday Vanshi !!! 🥳 I’m grateful to have you in my life since you came everything changed and I finally had a friend that I can talk for hours and talk about anything that has happened. I am thankful of god for having you in my life when I needed someone and still having you is a very big thing for me. Also this year you  told me a very big thing about us being together that I was scared of that Will I be able to tell you the very same by my self. Pan Touch-wood I had someone who understands me very well and its none other than you to stood up and tell it by yourself. If I was the one telling this no one knows meh keklo time litho hot ane koi apdi life mah biju koi ai gayu hotu. I know we haven’t talked about this topic for a very long time now but I still want to tell you that it has been in my mind since you have told me but didn’t had a chance to break it once again roj ni conversation mah pan you can ask Devarsh for that he is teasing me from the day I have told him about the thing that happened between us ane mane tease karya kare and all 😂 joke aside I just want to make a little gift for you as in person to ai nah shaku apva so once again a very very happy birthday to you hope you have a great day this birthday 🎂💕☺️.
